Here's a README file for your Fun Calculator code!

# 🎉 Fun Calculator! 🎉

Welcome to the **Fun Calculator** – a simple, interactive calculator built in Python that allows you to **add, subtract, multiply, and divide** two numbers with style and a smile! 😎✨

## Features

- Accepts decimal numbers (floats) for extra flexibility!
- Computes the **sum**, **difference**, **product**, and **quotient** of two user-supplied numbers.
- Simple, easy-to-read output for quick math results.
- Beginner-friendly, with fun comments and explanations throughout the code!

## Usage

1. **Run the script** in your terminal or favorite Python environment:
   ```bash
   python fun_calculator.py
   ```
2. **Follow the prompts:**
   - Enter the first number (can be a decimal).
   - Enter the second number (can also be a decimal).
3. **Get your results!**
   - The calculator will print the sum, difference, product, and quotient of your inputs.

## Example

```shell
Enter the first number: 8.5
Enter the second number: 2
Results of your two numbers:
Sum: 10.5
Difference: 6.5
Product: 17.0
Quotient: 4.25
```

## Notes

- This calculator assumes **you won't divide by zero**. Please enter a nonzero second number for division.
- Feel free to enhance the code with error checking, more operations, or a snazzy user interface!

## How It Works

- The program uses `input()` to read user values and `float()` to allow decimal numbers.
- Basic arithmetic operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) are performed.
- Results are displayed using Python's `print()` and formatted strings.
